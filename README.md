# Supabase Social Authentication with Expo Router

With this repository, I wanted to give an example and guidance on how to use Supabase Social Authentication together with Expo Router v2. Both Google Authentication as well as Apple Authentication are covered.

Some of the used technologies are opinionated and can be replaced:

- Styled Components
- Prettier (with sorting config)
- ESLint

## ðŸš€ How to use

```sh
git clone git@github.com:rnnyrk/expo-router-supabase-social-auth.git YOUR_PROJECT
cd YOUR_PROJECT && npm install
npm run start
```
